Variable:
  to create a Variable:
    $primary: #3299ee;
  to use a Variable:
    color: $primary;

Partials:
  Partials is a way to split our code to multiple different files
  like CSS module
  to import Partials:
    at the top a scss files
    @import './path'

Avoid gulp compiling files
  To avoid the gulp compiler to compile files
  for example a files that only contain variables
  we need to add "_" after the file name
  "_variables.scss"

Import Oder:
  while importing the scss module, order matter
    @import "variables";
    @import "base";
  here the "base" module beneficiate from the variables declared
  in "variables" module that is because the import are read from
  top to bottom

Math Operation:
  in SASS it's possible to use math operator to interact 
  with our constant 
    Multiple:
      $font-size-sm: $base-font-size * 0.75;
    Divide:
      To divide we need to import at the top of the 
      file where we use the division the math module
        @use "sass:math";
      and then we can use the math method
        border-radius: math.div(base-border-radius, 4);

Debugging:
  To debug a SASS file we can use the debug directive which 
  print a value on the console
    @debug "hello world";
    @debug $base-border-radius * 4;
