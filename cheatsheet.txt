Variable:
  to create a Variable:

Partials:
  Partials is a way to split our code to multiple different files
  like CSS module
  to import Partials:
    at the top a scss files
    @import './path'

Avoid gulp compiling files
  To avoid the gulp compiler to compile files
  for example a files that only contain variables
  we need to add "_" after the file name
  "_variables.scss"

Import Oder:
  while importing the scss module, order matter
    @import "variables";
    @import "base";
  here the "base" module beneficiate from the variables declared
  in "variables" module that is because the import are read from
  top to bottom
